audio-visualizer-python
=======================

This is a little GUI tool which creates an audio visualization video from an input audio.
You can also give it a background image and set a title text.

So far I have only tested it under Linux (Ubuntu 14.10) but it should also work under Windows and Mac OS X. If you encounter problems
running it or have other bug reports or features, that you wish to see implemented, please fork the project and send me a pull request and/or file an issue on this project.

I also need a good name that is not as generic as "audio-visualizer-python"!

Dependencies
------------
You need Python 3, PyQt4, PIL, numpy and the program ffmpeg, which is used to read the audio and render the video.
